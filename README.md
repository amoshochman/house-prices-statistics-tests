Evaluating t-test, p-value and pearson correlation 
with one of the classic data sets for learning machine learning.



I'll go over these subjects with a simple-and-neat exercise. Given a dataset, we: <br>
1. Calculate the t-test between each 2 columns and then plot a heatmap.
2. Plot binary heatmaps using distinct p-values as the threshold.
3. Define a function that: provided a list of columns and a target column, calculates the Pearson Correlation between a linear combination of the columns list -using a provided list of weights-, and the target one.
4. Use the previous function to search among some random combinations for the one with the highest correlation.
